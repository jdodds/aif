# this config explains the (all) available options.
# the variables are optional and we define their defaults here (so you could omit the
# definitions), unless otherwise specified.

# Add all repositories you want to use here. Same style as for pacman.conf:
# Local: file://...
# Remote: something like ftp://ftp.belnet.be/mirror/archlinux.org/$repo/os/$arch
# You should list both the name of the repo as well as the location, as separate
# elements.
# You can add multiple repositories and even mix remote and local ones.
# The order they are in here, will be the order in pacman.conf
# This is a mandatory variable, which should contain at least 1 core repository
# This example will do the most sensible thing on both core and netinstall images:
if [ -d /repo/core ]; then
	TARGET_REPOSITORIES=(core 'file:///repo/$repo/$arch')
else
	MIRROR='ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch'
	TARGET_REPOSITORIES=(core $var_MIRRORLIST) # $var_MIRRORLIST is set by AIF
fi

TARGET_PACKAGES='openssh e2fsprogs' # you can also specify separate packages to install (this is empty by default)

# you can optionally also override some functions...
# This way you can change/extend/remove pretty much all functionality in AIF !
